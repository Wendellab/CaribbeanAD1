### LDdecay analysis used [PopLDdecay](https://github.com/BGI-shenzhen/PopLDdecay)

#### since the analysis is sensitive for minor allele frequency filtering and LD pruning, so we did not performed any additional filtering other than biallelic and depth, however, the sample size is small for this analysis. We also performed a downsampling (n=5) for this analaysis for 20 replicates
